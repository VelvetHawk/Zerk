                Any idea where those car keys might be?

                Have you made much progress with the cleanup?

                The sun is looking quite nice today. Reminds me
                of when I was young.

                I remember getting a lot of the bait from a little grove.
                Maybe have a look around in that area?

                I've tidied most of it up, but need those keys to open up
                the boot. Let me know when you find them.

                Oh I remember how much you loved the sunsets my boy. You'd
                sit around with us watching it every summer. Memories like
                that will never fade.
