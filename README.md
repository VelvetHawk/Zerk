# Zerk : An Original Tale (CS4076)

This was a solo project written in C++ using the Qt framework that I had in my third year at uni. The aim of the project was to build a Zork clone using principles of event-driven programming. We had to design a functioning GUI which interacted with the game's back-end, ie, instead of taking in console input, you used a graphical user interface.

And so, the aptly named 'Zerk' was born.
