        <description>
            An old dock, primarily used for fishing. You see your grandfather resting on his
            fishing stool.

            You're a decent amount down the the side of the lake. You're very close to the water's edge right now.
            There's doesn't seem to be much here, apart from some swan droppings.

            You're starting to get reasonably far from the fishing spot. You sure you want to be this far?

        <description>
            You can barely see the fishing spot from here anymore. I don't think it's wise to continue east,
            for fear of getting lost. But otherwise, the view of the lake here is quite lovely.

            A woodland is a low-density forest with plenty of sunlight
            and limited shade. It forms an open habitat. This is the
            north side of this one.

            Woodlands have an understory of shrubs and herbaceous plants including
            grasses. Woodlands grade into shrubland in drier conditions or in early
            stages of plant succession. Higher densities and areas of trees, with
            largely closed canopy, and nearly continuous shade and are often called
            forests. This is the north-eastern side of this one.

            Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
            and sorry I could not travel both
            and be one traveler, long I stood
            and looked down one as far as I could
            to where it bent in the undergrowth

            I could've sworn I've passed those trees more than once?
            Though, why is one of them covered in moss and the other
            wet...?

            I shall be telling this with a sigh
            somewhere ages and ages hence:
            Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
            I took the one less traveled by,
            and that has made all the difference.
